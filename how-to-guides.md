Windows firewall at it's core, is designed to protect information on your computor against malicuous attacks on networks such as your Internet.

## How to Change a Car's Oil

Although the steps below are relevant to most car models, it is advised to check your car manual for specific procedure guidance according to your vehicle model. 

To succesfully perform the following procedure you will need:
    - a new oil filter suitable for your specific vechile model
    - clean enigne oil
    - a new oil plug and seal suitable for your vechile model

1. **Check the Specifications** 

    First of all it is important to check your car's manual for the oil filter specifications to make sure you buy the right oil filter, and check the amount of oil required for your specific engine.

2. **Safely Jack up your Car**

    Make sure to put your safety first by jacking up the car and using a jack stand (not only your jack) to secure your vehicle in the air.  Your car's manual should specify where to place the jack stand on the floor jack in order to lift your car safely.

3. **Remove the Plastic Cover**

    If your car has a plastic cover underneath to cover the engine, you will need to remove this first. (Some cars have a seperate hatch on the plastic cover to easily reach the oil filter and drain plug, in this case you don't need to remove the plastic engine cover.)

4. **Replace the Oil Filter**

    It is important to replace the oil filter first to also drain the dirty oil from the filter cup on the top of the engine.

    The most common location for an insert filter is at the top of the engine. Replace it together with all **0-rings and double check that the oil filter cap is tightened to the specified torque**.

    A plate filter is usually found underneath the engine. 
    > You can replace the oil for a *plate filter* before or after the oil change.

5. **Drain the Oil**

    Search for the **drain plug** on the oil pan underneath the engine. 
    > Make sure that you are unscrewing the correct screw, double check this in your car's manual. Unscrewing the wrong screw and draining the oil from your gearbox can be rather difficult to replace.

    Once allocated, remove it and allow the oil to drain out. This can take some time.

    Replace the **oil plug** and the **seal** to prevent an oil leak.

    Now make sure to use a torque wrench to tighten the oil plug. You can consult your car's manual for the correct torque specifications.

6. **Replace the Engine Oil**

    Remove the **dipstick** to remove any air from the engine

    Finally you can fill up the engine with fresh, clean **engine oil**, be sure to fill the required amount through the **oil cap** at the top of the engine.
    > Do not spill any oil over the other engine parts.

    Once you have filled your engine with the required amount of oil, check the oil dipstick - it should be slightly above the *MAX* symbol.

7. **Time to Start the Engine**

    Switch on your engine to make sure that the red oil pressure light on the dashboard comes on and then turns off after a few seconds.

    Start the engine and let it idle to refill the new oil filter with oil, you can switch it off after 15 seconds.

8. **Check the Dipstick**

    After switching your engine off, **wait 5 minutes** so that the oil can flow into the oil pan.
    Then check the dipstick, the oil level should now be between *Min* and *Max*.

    > Sometimes the oil level can be on the *Max* sign, double check your car's manual to see what it should be on.

9. **Start the Engine Again**

    If the oil level is as specified, you can start your car again and let it idle for 10 minutes. Check that **no oil is leaking form the screw plug or filter**.

10. **Final step**
    
    Remove the jack stand and take your car for a short drive, make sure to lift your car again when you return to double check for signs of oil leaking underneath the car from the oil filter or oil plug.

    You can replace the plastic engine cover if there are no leaks.

    Lastly, check the oil dipstick again to make sure that the oil level is correct.

### Conclusion

If you have question about your specific oil filter, the amount of oil required according to your vehicle model or about the procedure, you can always call your local dealership for more advise, or visit your local auto parts store.
